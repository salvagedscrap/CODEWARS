/*Description:

I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays...actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.*/

//SOLUTION



function arrayPlusArray(arr1, arr2) {
  
  
  
  let sum= 0
  for(let i = 0; i<arr1.length; i++){
    sum+= arr1[i]
  }
  for(let i = 0; i<arr2.length; i++){
  sum+= arr2[i]
  }
  return sum
}
